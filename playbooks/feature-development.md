description: End-to-end feature development playbook. Takes a feature description, generates BDD scenarios for sign-off, implements, runs tests, and ships. Use when starting a new feature from scratch.

# Feature Development Workflow

A full-cycle workflow from feature description to shipped code:

1. **BDD scenarios** — clarify requirements and get sign-off before coding
2. **Implementation** — build the feature following project conventions
3. **Test runner** — verify everything passes
4. **Ship** — commit and push

## Usage

```
/feature-development "add export to CSV on the reports page"
```

## Workflow

### Stage 1: BDD Scenarios (Requirements Sign-off)

Use the `bdd-gherkin` skill with the feature description:

```
Run the bdd-gherkin skill for: $ARGUMENTS
```

- Collaborate with the user to clarify requirements
- Produce Gherkin scenarios covering happy path, edge cases, and error handling
- **Stop here and wait for explicit user approval of the scenarios before proceeding**
- Do not start implementation until the user confirms the scenarios are correct

### Stage 2: Implementation

Once scenarios are approved:

1. Read the relevant parts of the codebase to understand the existing structure
2. Implement the feature following the approved scenarios as acceptance criteria
3. Use the `conventions-check` skill to validate your changes before finalising:
   ```
   Run conventions-check on the changed files
   ```
4. Fix any convention errors before moving to Stage 3

### Stage 3: Tests

Delegate to the `test-runner` agent:

```
Use the test-runner agent to run the full test suite
```

- All existing tests must still pass
- If the project uses BDD/integration tests, verify the new scenarios pass too
- Fix any regressions before proceeding

### Stage 4: Ship

Use the `ship` skill:

```
Run the ship skill
```

- Runs a final conventions check on staged files
- Generates a commit message with ticket ID from branch name
- Commits and pushes
