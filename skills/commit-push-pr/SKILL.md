# Commit, Push, and Open a PR

## Overview

This skill handles the full commit → push → PR workflow. It confirms the commit message, PR title, and PR description with the user before doing anything irreversible.

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Assess the Current State

Run these commands in parallel:

1. `git status` — see staged, unstaged, and untracked files (never use `-uall`)
2. `git diff` — see unstaged changes
3. `git diff --cached` — see already-staged changes
4. `git log --oneline -5` — see recent commit style for message consistency
5. `git branch --show-current` — identify the current branch
6. `git remote get-url origin` — identify the remote

If there are no changes, inform the user and stop.

Check that `gh` is authenticated: run `gh auth status`. If not authenticated, tell the user to run `gh auth login` and stop.

---

### Step 2: Stage Changes

- Stage all modified and relevant files using `git add` with specific file paths.
- Do NOT stage secrets or credentials (`.env`, `credentials.json`, `*.key`, `*.pem`). Warn the user and skip them.
- Do NOT use `git add -A` or `git add .`.

---

### Step 3: Generate a Commit Message

Analyze `git diff --cached` and draft a commit message following **Conventional Commits** (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

#### Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

#### Types

| Type | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | A new feature |
| `fix` | A bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace — no logic change |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring, no feature or fix |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `build` | Build system or dependency changes |
| `ci` | CI configuration changes |
| `chore` | Maintenance, no src/test changes |

#### Rules

- Description: lowercase, imperative mood, no period, under 72 characters
- Body: explain *why*, not what — separated by a blank line
- For breaking changes: add `!` after type/scope and a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer
- Always append as the final footer:
  ```

  ```

### Step 4: Confirm the Commit Message

**Mandatory.** Use `AskUserQuestion` to show the proposed message and get approval.

Options: "Use this message" / "Edit message" (user types their own).

Do NOT commit without explicit approval.

---

### Step 5: Commit

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<approved message>

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

If a pre-commit hook fails: report the error, do NOT use `--no-verify`, fix and create a NEW commit (never amend).

---

### Step 6: Push

1. Check upstream: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref @{upstream}`
2. No upstream → `git push -u origin <branch-name>`
3. Upstream exists → `git push`

If the push is rejected, inform the user and suggest next steps. Do NOT force-push without explicit approval.

---

### Step 7: Determine the Base Branch

Run:
```bash
gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq '.defaultBranchRef.name'
```

Also check if a `develop` branch exists:
```bash
git branch -r | grep -E 'origin/(develop|main|master)'
```

Use this priority to pick the base branch:
1. `develop` — if it exists on the remote
2. `main` — if it exists
3. `master` — fallback
4. Ask the user if none of the above are found

---

### Step 8: Generate PR Title and Description

Derive the PR title from the commit message subject line (the first line).

For the description, analyze the full diff (`git log <base>..<current-branch> --oneline` and `git diff <base>..HEAD`) and generate:

```markdown
## Summary

- [bullet points describing what changed and why]

## Test plan

- [ ] [specific things a reviewer should verify, based on the actual changes]

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
```

Tailor the test plan to the actual changes — don't use generic placeholders.

---

### Step 9: Confirm PR Title and Description with the User

**Mandatory.** Show the proposed PR title and description and ask for approval before creating the PR.

Use `AskUserQuestion`:

> "Here's the PR I'll open against `[base branch]`:
>
> **Title:** [proposed title]
>
> **Description:**
> [proposed description]
>
> Does this look good?"

Options:
- **Looks good, create the PR** — proceed
- **Edit the title** — ask the user to type a new title, then re-confirm
- **Edit the description** — ask the user to type or paste a new description, then re-confirm
- **Cancel** — stop without creating the PR

Do NOT create the PR without explicit user approval.

---

### Step 10: Create the PR

```bash
gh pr create \
  --base <base-branch> \
  --title "<approved title>" \
  --body "<approved description>"
```

Use a HEREDOC for the body to preserve formatting:

```bash
gh pr create --base <base-branch> --title "<approved title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
<approved description>
EOF
)"
```

---

### Step 11: Summary

After a successful PR creation, report:

```
✅ Done!

Commit:  <short hash> — <commit subject>
Branch:  <branch> → <base-branch>
PR:      <PR URL>
```
