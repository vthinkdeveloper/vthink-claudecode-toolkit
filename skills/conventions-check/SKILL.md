name: conventions-check
description: Check code changes against project conventions. Accepts a PR number or file paths/globs. Discovers conventions from the codebase itself and reports violations in naming, patterns, and file organization. Use when asked to "check conventions", "review code style", "audit patterns", or "validate naming".

# Code Conventions Checker

## Overview

This skill checks code changes against the conventions established in the project's own codebase. Rather than enforcing a fixed ruleset, it **discovers** conventions by examining the project's configuration files, documentation, and existing code patterns — then validates changes against those conventions.

It works in two modes:
- **PR mode**: Pass a PR number to analyze all changed files in a pull request
- **File mode**: Pass file paths or glob patterns to check specific files

## Workflow

### Step 1: Detect Input Mode and Gather Files

Determine if `$ARGUMENTS` is a PR number (digits only) or file path(s).

**If PR number (digits only):**
1. Use Bash to run: `gh pr diff <number> --name-only` to get the list of changed files
2. Use Bash to run: `gh pr diff <number>` to get the full diff for context
3. Read each changed file in full using the Read tool

**If file path(s) or glob pattern(s):**
1. Use Glob to expand any patterns and collect the list of files to check
2. Read each file's contents using the Read tool

### Step 2: Discover Project Conventions

Before checking anything, learn what conventions this specific project follows. Read these sources **in order of priority** (skip any that don't exist):

1. **`CLAUDE.md`** (project root) — Often contains explicit architecture, patterns, and coding conventions
2. **Linter/formatter configs** — Search for and read:
   - `.eslintrc`, `.eslintrc.js`, `.eslintrc.json`, `.eslintrc.yml`
   - `.prettierrc`, `prettier.config.js`
   - `checkstyle.xml`, `.editorconfig`
   - `tslint.json`, `biome.json`
   - `pom.xml` (for Java plugin configs like compiler version, encoding)
   - `package.json` (for `eslintConfig`, `prettier` fields, and scripts like `lint`)
3. **Existing code patterns** — For each file type being checked, read 2-3 existing files of the same type in the same directory or nearby directories to identify:
   - Naming conventions (classes, methods, files, variables)
   - Import ordering and style
   - Annotation/decorator usage patterns
   - Error handling patterns
   - Test structure and assertion style

### Step 3: Internal Consistency Analysis

Before checking against external rules, perform a **within-file consistency scan**. This catches deviations that no linter config would flag — patterns that are correct in isolation but inconsistent with the rest of the file:

1. **Collect all similar constructs** — group every instance of: error responses, status codes, variable naming style, string quote style, comment style, and return patterns
2. **Identify the dominant pattern** — for each group, determine what 80%+ of instances do (e.g., 4 out of 5 error responses use `{ error: '...' }`)
3. **Flag outliers** — any instance that deviates from the dominant pattern is a finding, even if the deviant form is valid on its own

This is critical because inconsistency within a single file is often more confusing to readers than a globally "wrong" but consistent style.

### Step 4: Analyze Changes Against Conventions

For each changed/target file, check against the applicable conventions based on file type. Apply discovered rules, filtered by what's actually relevant to this project.

**Severity levels:**
- **Error** — Clear violation of an explicit project rule (from CLAUDE.md, linter config, or universal convention)
- **Warning** — Deviation from the established pattern in surrounding code
- **Info** — Suggestion based on best practices that the project doesn't explicitly enforce but might benefit from

**For each finding, record:**
- File (user-friendly relative path)
- Line(s) affected
- Rule violated
- Severity (Error / Warning / Info)
- What was found vs. what was expected
- Suggested fix (one-liner)

### Step 5: Generate Report

Present findings in the conversation using this structure:

```
## Conventions Check Report

**Mode:** PR #<number> / Files: <list>
**Files checked:** <count>
**Findings:** <error-count> errors, <warning-count> warnings, <info-count> info

---

### Summary

| Severity | Count | Categories |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Error    | N     | <which rule categories> |
| Warning  | N     | <which rule categories> |
| Info     | N     | <which rule categories> |

### Findings by File

#### <relative/path/to/file.ext>

| # | Severity | Rule | Line(s) | Finding | Suggestion |
|---|----------|------|---------|---------|------------|
| 1 | Error    | <rule-id> | 42 | <what's wrong> | <how to fix> |
| 2 | Warning  | <rule-id> | 15-18 | <what's wrong> | <how to fix> |

### Conventions Discovered

<Brief list of conventions that were auto-discovered from this project's config and code patterns, so the user can verify the checker's understanding.>
```

**If no findings:** Report a clean bill of health with a summary of what was checked.

**Important rules for the report:**
- Always use relative file paths from the project root
- Include line numbers so developers can navigate directly
- Keep suggestions actionable and specific — "Rename to `FooService`" not "Follow naming conventions"
- Group findings by file, ordered by severity (errors first)
- Don't report on files that have zero findings (keep the report focused)
- If a convention conflict is found (e.g., CLAUDE.md says one thing but existing code does another), flag it as Info and note the discrepancy
